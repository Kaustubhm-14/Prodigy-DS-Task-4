## üìå Project Objective
As part of Task 4 in the **Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship**, this project focuses on building an **Email Spam Detection system** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Supervised Machine Learning** techniques.

---

## üìÇ Dataset Used
- **Dataset Name**: Spam SMS or Email Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) / Kaggle
- **Content**: Text messages labeled as `ham` (not spam) or `spam`

---

## üß† Problem Statement
Develop a predictive model that can classify a given message as **Spam** or **Ham** (Not Spam) by leveraging:
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, normalization)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF/CountVectorizer)
- Classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- `NLTK` / `re` (for text preprocessing)
- `Scikit-learn` (for vectorization, modeling, evaluation)
- `Jupyter Notebook`

---

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing
   - Tokenization
   - Stopword removal
   - Lemmatization/Stemming

## ‚úÖ Conclusion & Learnings
- Applied complete NLP pipeline from raw text to model inference
- Learned practical techniques for text cleaning and feature extraction
- Gained clarity on classification trade-offs (Precision vs Recall in spam detection)
- Developed a deployable ML pipeline for real-world text data
